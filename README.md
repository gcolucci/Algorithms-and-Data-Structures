# Algorithms and Data Structures

A collection of implementations of Computer Science famous algorithms and data structures.

It is both a personal hobby and a way to keep these concepts fresh in my head. I hope it can be useful for CS practitioners. I am not particularly concerned about generalizability of data types.

Please, feel free to provide any sort of feedback. I thank all possible inputs and suggestions in advance ;)
